This is my personal bash profile. 
history.sh is from oh-my-bash: https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash
git-prompt.sh and git-completion.sh are from git repository: https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/completion

Usage:
- Clone repo
`git clone https://github.com/rahmanuh/my-bash-profile.git .my-bash-profile`
- Source the 'main' file to .bashrc
`source $HOME/.my-bash-profile/my-bash-profile.sh`
- Reload current terminal
`source .bashrc`
